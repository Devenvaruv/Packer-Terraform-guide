# AWS Infrastructure with Packer and Terraform

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI) using [Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/install) and then provision AWS resources using [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform).

### What the project does

1. **Custom AWS AMI (Packer)**
   - Starts with **Amazon Linux**.
   - Installs **Docker**.
   - Injects your **SSH public key** so you can log in using the corresponding private key.

2. **Provision AWS resources (Terraform)**
   - Creates a **VPC** with private and public subnets, plus the necessary routes (using Terraform modules).
   - Sets up **1 Bastion Host** in the public subnet (restricted access on port 22 to your IP address).
   - Launches **6 EC2 instances** in the private subnet based on the custom AMI you created via Packer.

After successful deployment, you will be able to:
- SSH into the bastion host using your private key.
- From the bastion host, SSH into any of the 6 private EC2 instances.

## Prerequisites

1. **Packer**  
   Install [Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/install).  
   - **Windows**: `choco install packer`
   - **Mac**: Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):  
     ```bash
     brew tap hashicorp/tap
     brew install hashicorp/tap/packer
     ```

2. **Terraform**  
   Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform).  
   - **Windows**: `choco install terraform`
   - **Mac**: Use Homebrew:  
     ```bash
     brew tap hashicorp/tap
     brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
     ```

Verify the Installation

Run packer in your terminal. You should see a help message or usage instructions.

3. **AWS Credentials**  
   You will need the following from your AWS account:
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
    
   if you are on AWS Academy click on Show to get them

5. **SSH Keys**
   - **Public key**: Will be baked into the AMI so you can SSH in.
   - **Private key**: Used to SSH into instances (keep this secure).
   if you do not want to use the old key you can generate a new key by running this command
    ```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

6. **Git**
   - Install Git to clone the repository.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devenvaruv/Packer-Terraform-guide.git
   cd Packer-Terraform-guide
Set Environment Variables
Depending on your OS:

Windows (PowerShell)

    $env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    $env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    $env:AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"

Mac / Linux (Bash)

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"




### Building the Custom AMI (Packer)
Navigate to the Packer directory:

    cd packer
Build the AMI with your public key:

copy your public key value and paste it below
![alt text](./assets/image-3.png)

Windows (PowerShell) example:

    packer build -var "public_key=ssh-rsa AAAAB..... @youruser" custom-ami.json

Mac / Linux example:

    packer build -var "public_key=ssh-rsa AAAAB..... @youruser" custom-ami.json

Note: -var flag expected the actual value of the key not the path of the key.

if you get any error related to amazon-ebs run this command and then run the original again

    packer plugins install github.com/hashicorp/amazon

Wait for the build to complete (approximately 3â€“4 minutes).

Start of build

Upon success, Packer will output the AMI ID.

![alt text](./assets/image-5.png)

The same AMI ID will also appear in manifest.json.

![alt text](./assets/image-6.png)

Copy the newly created AMI ID.

### Provisioning Infrastructure (Terraform)
Navigate back to the main folder, then into the Terraform directory:

    cd ..
    cd terraform

Update terraform.tfvars with your newly created AMI ID:

    custom_ami_id = "ami-XXXXXXXXXXXXX"
Replace "ami-XXXXXXXXXXXXX" with the actual AMI ID from your Packer build.

### Initialize, Plan, and Apply with Terraform:

    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply

![alt text](./assets/image-8.png)

When prompted, type yes to confirm.

Upon successful completion, Terraform will output:

The Public IP address of the bastion host.

The Private IP addresses (or private DNS) of the six EC2 instances.

### Connecting to Your Instances

Add Your Private Key to SSH Agent (if needed):

    ssh-add -l

If no key is listed, add it:

    ssh-add /path/to/your_private_key
SSH into the Bastion Host:

    ssh -A -i "/path/to/your_private_key" ec2-user@YOUR_BASTION_PUBLIC_IP

![alt text](./assets/image-12.png)

-A forwards your SSH agent, allowing you to SSH into the private instances without copying the private key onto the bastion.

From the Bastion Host, SSH into a Private EC2 Instance:

    ssh ec2-user@PRIVATE_EC2_IP

![alt text](./assets/image-13.png)

You are now inside one of your private EC2 instances.
